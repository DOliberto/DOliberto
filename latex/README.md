# doliberto LaTeX class

`doliberto.cls` is a LaTeX class for typesetting a Di√°rio Oficial
(D.O., public gazette).

originally it is meant to typeset Mesquita's D.O., but is flexible
enough to handle other government units, as along as the style is to
be the same.

it requires XeLaTeX to compile, as we like UTF-8 and native font
support by default. (it can probably be compiled with LuaTeX too, but
we haven't tried that yet).
